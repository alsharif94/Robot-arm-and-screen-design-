# Robot-arm-and-screen-design-


In this task, we will design two arms for the robot and operate the screen for the robot that represents the face of the robot. Initially, we will design the robotic arms by using six servo motors. We will determine the initial position of each servo motor, depending on what the mechanical engineer will determine. In the second part of the mission, we will learn about a new type of sensor, the ultrasonic sensor, which enables us to calculate distances by using ultrasound waves, and this will benefit us in sensing the objects near the robot, and accordingly the robot will interact with nearby objects. In the last section, we will learn how to connect the microcontroller to the Bluetooth to turn on the screen of the robot. This will give us many advantages, which is to reduce the wires connected to the microcontroller and other advantages.

I will design the arms of the robot by using the servo motor. I will use six servo motors distributed on the arms. We will choose an initial angle for the servo motor depending on the information of the electrical engineer. I will use the Arduino as a microcontroller as in the previous tasks and Protues as a simulation program to make sure that the program works before installing and connecting the electronic circuit
